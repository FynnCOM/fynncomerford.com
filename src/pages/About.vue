        My name is Fynn Comerford and I am studying Neuroscience at The University of Manchester. I am commited to help solve the world's biggest problems.
        I want to participate in research that helps solve big health problems.

         I am particularly
fascinated by the opportunities emerging at the intersection of artificial intelligence and
cutting edge neuroscientific and biomedical research. Brain-computer interfaces,
neuroprosthetics and personalized medicine are part of a bright future I want to dedicate my
life to. I am certain that groundbreaking discoveries and technologies with the aim to relieve
people from their burdens are just around the corner and I can not wait to be part of it.
