        Hyperloop is Elon Muskâ€™s concept for the future of mass transportation. It offers a new means
        of transporting people and goods quickly, safely, efficiently, and with minimised
        environmental impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Hyperloop uses electric propulsion to accelerate a passenger or cargo pod through a
        low-pressure tube. The autonomous pod employs magnetic levitation to eliminate friction. The
        Hyperloop would allow travel times considerably shorter than current rail or air travel
        times. Carbon emissions, noise, delays, journey time, weather concerns and pilot error are
        ultimately eliminated.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2017, I joined HYPED, a team of over 100+ students across academic disciplines at the
        University of Edinburgh dedicated to accelerating the development of Hyperloop. HYPED is
        advancing both technical and commercial development of Hyperloop, having seen success in two
        international competitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the SpaceX Competition 2018, we spent a year designing and engineering our very own
        Hyperloop Pod. Our pod made use of passive magnetic levitation, Halbach wheel propulsion and
        highly sophisticated software for navigation and control systems.
        <br />After months of hard work, we got selected for the finals of the SpaceX Competition in
        Hawthorne, California.
        <br />The final week was an extremely challenging but exciting experience. Engineers from SpaceX
        walked us through a variety of hard technical tests and challenges that were able to manage
        very successfully. Due to a malfunction of our CAN-BUS tranceiver at the very end, we were
        not able to make it to the last run but we were very happy to have reached the 6th place
        among hundreds of universities.
